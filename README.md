### [M01] Water Strider
#### abbrev
* SMA: shape memory alloy 形状记忆合金
* SCM: smart composite microstructures

#### Key word
* Passive Trigger
  * Experiments were performed on a range of passive trigger specimens to determine the relationship between pulling force and deflection (Fig. S6C).
  * Using the model, we can design the triggering force of the passive trigger when it attains the required deflection for triggering.

* Stiffness of the Sheet SMA Actuator
  * Finally, the stiffness of the actuator, *k*, can be calculated by dividing the triggering force by actuator stroke: ...
  * By varying the design of the passive trigger, various robot prototypes with different actuator stiffnesses were prepared. Table S2 lists their driving forces.

* Fabrication and Materials
  * The robot structure was designed so that the smart composite microstructures (SCM) manufacturing process could be applied (24).
